    "text": "Almost 100 years of aerial imagery in Iowa show the impacts of a logjam in a single reach. Preliminary findings suggest that the reach with a logjam present multiple times throughout the image history has a dynamic channel planform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical channel margins of a dynamic reach buffered by agricultural fields.\n\nWood loads have been reduced in river corridors directly through wood removal and indirectly through deforestation for centuries. Agricultural regions are especially impacted. Our study site is a unique reach in Iowa that has consistently had logjams form in the same location over decades. There is a rich history of a meandering and bifurcation associated with this logjam. In the field we identified floodplain forests made up of diverse species and age classes.\nThis work is in-progress, stay tuned for upcoming presentations and publications!\n\n\nWood transport during a high flow."

    "text": "Wildfire causes a cascade of disturbances that threaten water quality, human infrastructure, and life. We surveyed geomorphic, vegetation, and burn characteristics from the headwaters to the outlets of catchments that burned in the Cameron Peak fire in 2020s. Reach-scale characteristics rather than catchment-scale were best correlated with severity of flooding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater ponded behind beaver berms at the most resilient catchment, Jack’s Gulch\n\nOur conceptualization of the wildfire disturbance cascade includes characteristics that drive and resist response to disturbance. As driving characteristics like burn extent or precipitation increase, we expect that a catchment would respond with a larger flood that causes more geomorphic change. This would indicate a less resilient catchment. The inverse is implied to be true, where we conceptulize resilience as increasing with increasing resisting characteristics.\nWithin most of our seven study catchments, we found that more resilient catchments were made up of reaches with lower slopes, wider floodplains, more beaver berms and logjams, and more multi-stem deciduous vegetation like willow and alder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebris fan at the least resilient catchment, Black Hollow.

    "text": "Logjams, formerly abundant in forested catchments, serve important hydrologic, geomorphic, and ecological roles. We delineated spatial and temporal domains for logjam storage in the Southern Rockies. Additionally, we explored the implications of these analyses with smaller datasets.\nWe found that elevation, morphology, and disturbance history acted as controls on the spatial distribution of logjams storage. When we iteratively decreased the sample size, we found that we were able to delineate these same spatial process domains using anywhere from 50-200 reaches rather than the full dataset of over 300 reaches. This implies that spatial controls on logjam storage could be identified for this region with substantially fewer than 300 reaches, which is a far more achievable sample size from a fieldwork perspective.\nFind out more at AGU in December!
