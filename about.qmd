Water has played a central role in my life in everything from recreation to pursuing a career in research. I've always taken every opportunity to get my feet wet. My first foray into scientific research was assisting with a project studying terrapins in the Chesapeake Bay. This work opened a door to field research and set me on a path towards river science.

As a current PhD student in the [Fluvial Geomorphology Group](https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/fluvial-geomorphology/) at Colorado State University (CSU), I'm motivated by applicable research that investigates river corridor forms and processes across scales.
